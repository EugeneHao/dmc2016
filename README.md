## prudsys 2016 Data Mining Cup

From the [prudsys task description](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/wettbewerb/aufgabe.html):

> ###Scenario
> The central topic of this yearâ€™s task in the DATA MINING CUP competition is the prediction of the return rates for a fashion distributor. Returns have been a major cost driver for online shops for many years. This is particularly the case for assortments in the fashion industry. Many approaches to solve this problem are based on forecasting models. Predicting returns was the central topic in the DATA MINING CUP of 2014. This year we look at the topic in more detail focusing in particular on the influence of discounted items and vouchers on return rates. 

> ###About the task
> A fashion distributor sells articles of particular sizes and colors to its customers. In some cases items are returned to the distributor for various reasons. The order data and the related return data were recorded over a two-year period. The aim is to use this data and methods of data mining to build a model which enables a good prediction of return rates.

Do NOT commit data files unless they are tracked by Git LFS. See [```.gitattributes```](./.gitattributes) for a list of file types that are currently tracked by Git LFS.**

If you want to add a new file type to be tracked by Git LFS, like ```.Rds``` files for example, use the command 

```bash
git lfs track "*.Rds"
``` 

This is better than attempting to edit the ```.gitattributes``` file directly. The following resources provide all the information you need to install and use Git LFS:
