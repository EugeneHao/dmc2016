Xiaojun Mao introduced his exploration of raw data. He presented features of the training data and testing data.

Problems:

- Missing data in “productGroup”, “rep” & “voucherID”;
- Abnormal entries in raw data, like value 0 for “quantity”, “rep”;
- Explanations for value 0 for “voucherID”;

Suggestions:

- Create columns of “Year” “Month” “Week” from “OrderDate”;
- Create columns for return rate for each order / article;
- Create error function for prediction.
